This program will generate a random integer between 1 and 20 and based no
the result of the random number, we check to see if it falls under certain range
If the number is greater than 15, then it will print "cherries" 
otherwise if the number is greater > 10 then it will print "orange"
otherwise if the number is greater > 5 then it will print "plus"
otherwise if the number is greater > 2 then it will print "melon"
otherwise if the number is greater > 1 then it will print "bell"
if the number is not any of the above then it will print "bar"

we start by using a loop 3 times and print the results to the user. Example "plus cherries"
